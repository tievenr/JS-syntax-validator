# JavaScript Syntax Validator

This project provides a set of Python-based tools for validating and parsing JavaScript code. It includes custom lexers and parsers for different JavaScript constructs such as classes, conditionals, functions, objects, and variables. Each module is organized for targeted syntax analysis and validation.

## Features

- Lexical analysis and parsing for JavaScript classes, conditionals, functions, objects, and variables
- Modular structure for easy extension and maintenance
- Written in Python for flexibility and integration

## Directory Structure

- `JsClasses/` — Lexer and parser for JavaScript classes
- `JsCond/` — Lexer and parser for JavaScript conditionals
- `Jsfunc/` — Lexer and parser for JavaScript functions
- `JsObjects/` — Lexer and parser for JavaScript objects
- `JsVariables/` — Lexer and parser for JavaScript variables

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/)

## Usage

Each directory contains Python scripts for lexing and parsing the corresponding JavaScript construct. Run the lexer and parser scripts as needed for your use case.
